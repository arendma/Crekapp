% OptSigma = sigmaFitter(model_batch,Ptot,expVal,f)
% 
% Function that fits the average enzyme saturation factor in an ecModel
% according to a provided experimentally measured value for the objective
% function (i.e. growth rate at specified conditions)
%
% INPUTS:
%       model_batch     An EC batch model with an initial sigma factor
%                       assigned
%       Ptot            Total protein amount in the model (Experimental)
%                       [g/gDw]
%       expVal          Experimentally measured value for the objective function
%       f               Estimated mass fraction of enzymes in model [g/g]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       optSigma    The optimal sigma value obtained
